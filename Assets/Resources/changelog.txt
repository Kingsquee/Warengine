[Build 3.0]
-Miscellanious Changes

[Build 2.0]
-Fixed broken paths

[Build 1.0]
This is an unembellished reimplementation of Advance Wars' pathfinding. Unfortunately, the flexibility and speed of where the mouse can go is far greater than the GBA's D-pad, resulting in broken paths. For now, I've worked around this by limiting adding of new path nodes to those adjacent to the last node in the path. The next step will be to enhance this by auto-connecting broken paths using a seperate pathfinding function (A*). In the meantime, suffer through this crude buckleys-solution.
